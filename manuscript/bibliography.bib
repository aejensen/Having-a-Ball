abstract = {Summary. Models based on the bivariate Poisson distribution are used for modelling sports data. Independent Poisson distributions are usually adopted to model the number of goals of two competing teams. We replace the independence assumption by considering a bivariate Poisson model and its extensions. The models proposed allow for correlation between the two scores, which is a plausible assumption in sports with two opposing teams competing against each other. The effect of introducing even slight correlation is discussed. Using just a bivariate Poisson distribution can improve model fit and prediction of the number of draws in football games. The model is extended by considering an inflation factor for diagonal terms in the bivariate joint distribution. This inflation improves in precision the estimation of draws and, at the same time, allows for overdispersed, relative to the simple Poisson distribution, marginal distributions. The properties of the models proposed as well as interpretation and estimation procedures are provided. An illustration of the models is presented by using data sets from football and water-polo.},

abstract = {Summary.  In the course of national sports tournaments, usually lasting several months, it is expected that the abilities of teams taking part in the tournament will change over time. A dynamic extension of the Bradley–Terry model for paired comparison data is introduced to model the outcomes of sporting contests, allowing for time varying abilities. It is assumed that teams’ home and away abilities depend on past results through exponentially weighted moving average processes. The model proposed is applied to sports data with and without tied contests, namely the 2009–2010 regular season of the National Basketball Association tournament and the 2008–2009 Italian Serie A football season.},

 abstract = {In this article we give a general definition of residuals for regression models with independent responses. Our definition produces residuals that are exactly normal, apart from sampling variability in the estimated parameters, by inverting the fitted distribution function for each response value and finding the equivalent standard normal quantile. Our definition includes some randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM, or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary definitions of residuals fail. Quantile residuals are applied in this article to three example data sets.},
